Cordova app for a hombrew RPG system made by a friend of mine. Made by request from him and as a test for some AngularJS fun.

Right now there isn't a lot to do, as I've just gotten back to this and am working on resolving a mess I left myself while trying to be clever. 
It's mostly cleaned up and I'm working to wire the data model, once that's done there will be a bunch of formatting changes, and then some new templates to handle character creation. 
In the long term there will be another template to load and track character data for GMs and some adventure information.
